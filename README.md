## General Information

- In my full stack project, I used TurboRepo for its efficient management of multiple packages and shared dependencies, streamlining our development process. I implemented sign-in and sign-up functionalities to showcase my fullstack skills, demonstrating my capability in handling user authentication and secure data flow between the client and server

## Features

- SignIn, Signup
- Using "MUI Material" for UI styling.
- Linter and Prettier added
